# -RFID-Based-Access-Control-System-using-Arduino
This project uses an RFID reader (MFRC522) to scan RFID tags/cards. When an authorized UID is detected, a green LED lights up, a buzzer beeps, and a servo opens a gate. Unauthorized access triggers a red LED and buzzer alert. It's ideal for secure entry systems like doors or lockers.
